# Interactive Web Visualisations -  belly-button-challenge

This challenge contains the solution to the assignment "Interactive Web Visualizations" for the 14th section of the Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## Challenge Description:

The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore a dataset of [belly button biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). The data has been collected and published as part of the Belly Button Biodiversity Project.

The dashboard displays demographic information of each individual participant, a bar chart showing the top 10 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) found in each individual, and a bubble chart displaying all the OTUs found in an individual.

## Languages Used

JavaScript
D3.js
Plotly.js
HTML/CSS


To run the dashboard, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The dashboard will automatically load the first individual in the dataset, and the charts and demographic information will be displayed accordingly.

To explore data for a different individual, select their ID from the dropdown menu. The dashboard will update with the charts and demographic information for the selected individual.

## Credits

The project data is provided by the Belly Button Biodiversity Project. The starter code for the dashboard was provided by edX bootcamp, and was modified and extended by me as part of the homework assignment.
